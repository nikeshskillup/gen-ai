**Title: Writing a Dockerfile for Node.js App Deployment**

Estimate Time : 25 Min

**Objective:**
- Learn how to use ChatGPT for making a Dockerfile.
- Know how to ask questions about creating a Dockerfile.
- Feel free to ask ChatGPT for help while making your Dockerfile.
- Remember to give clear details when you ask ChatGPT for advice.


In this lab, we'll explore how generative AI can assist in creating a Dockerfile for a Node.js application. We'll be utilizing IBM's generative AI lab, powered by advanced language models. The goal is to generate the necessary code for our Dockerfile, simplifying the development of our Node.js application in a Docker environment.


#### What is a Dockerfile?
A Dockerfile is like a recipe for your application's environment. It contains a set of instructions that Docker uses to build a Docker image. This image, in turn, is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

#### Why do we use Dockerfiles?
Dockerfiles are crucial in the world of containerization, offering a standardized and reproducible way to package and deploy applications. They allow developers to encapsulate their applications and dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments. This not only simplifies the development process but also facilitates seamless collaboration and deployment.


### Now, we'll direct a few questions to Generative AI to craft a Dockerfile.

## Step 1: Set up the AI Classroom

When you launch the lab environment, left side of screen you will Generative AI as like this.

To begin, configure your AI classroom to optimize your learning experience.

Before starting the exercise, follow these steps:

#### 1. Name the Chat:
Click the little pencil in the top-left corner to give your chat a name.

#### 2. Choose the Model:
Go to the top-right corner and choose from the drop-down for the text generation exercise. (By default, it's set to gpt-3.5.)

#### 3. Provide Prompt Instructions:
Use the "Prompt Instructions" field in the upper right pane of the chat system to give instructions or specific details about the context of the required output. These instructions will be locked once the chat starts and cannot be modified later.

#### 4. Type Your Message:
Use the text box at the bottom of the page to write prompts and converse with the chat system. Enter your prompt to generate a Dockerfile, `Generate a Dockerfile for a Node.js application,` and click on `Start Chat.`

## Step 2: Start Generating Dockerfile

Once your AI Classroom is ready, let's proceed and ask Generative AI for assistance in writing a Dockerfile.

1. Enter your question in message box `What is Dockerfile ?`

You can see this response:

<img src="./images/what_dockerfile.png" alt="what is dockerfile">


2. Enter your question in message box `What are the requirements for a Dockerfile?`

You can see this response:

<img src="./images/req_dockerfile.png" alt="requirements dockerfile">

Read the result and ask one by one as requirement of dockerfile.


3. Enter your question in message box `What's the first crucial step when creating a Dockerfile for a Node.js application?`

You can see this response:

<img src="./images/base_image.png" alt="base image">


4. Enter your question in message box `Following the base image selection, Set the working directory inside the container to /app`

You can see this response:

<img src="./images/working_dir.png" alt="working directory ">


5. Enter your question in message box `As selected working directory /app, bring the package.json and package-lock.json  to the working directory`

You can see this response:

<img src="./images/package.png" alt="package.json and package-lock.json">

6. Enter your question in message box `Now how i install dependencies ? and Copy the remaining application code to the working directory ?`

You can see this response:

<img src="./images/install_depen.png" alt="install dependencies">

7. Enter your question in message box `Node.js app needs to be accessible on a specific port, what Dockerfile instruction do you include for this purpose?`

You can see this response:

<img src="./images/expose_port.png" alt="Expose Port">


8. Enter your question in message box `how to specify the command to start the Node.js application using CMD ?`

You can see this response:

<img src="./images/start_cmd.png" alt="Start Command">

9. `Combine all the steps to form a complete Dockerfile for a Node.js application`

You can see this response:

<img src="./images/complete_dockerfile.png" alt="complete Dockerfile">



**Summary:**

In this lab, we leveraged generative AI to simplify the creation of a Dockerfile for a Node.js application. By interacting with the AI in the designated classroom, we addressed key questions and steps involved in Dockerfile development. The generated Dockerfile serves as a foundation for deploying Node.js applications in a containerized environment. This experience showcases the potential of generative AI in enhancing the efficiency of Docker-based development workflows. Through guided interactions, learners gained valuable insights into the Dockerfile creation process, making it more accessible and practical for real-world application deployments.
