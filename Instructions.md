**Title: Write a DockerfileÂ for a Node app deployment**

**Introduction:**
In this lab, we'll explore how generative AI can help create a Dockerfile for a Node.js application. We'll be using IBM's generative AI lab, which is powered by advanced language models. The goal is to generate the necessary code for our Dockerfile, making it easier to develop our Node.js application in a Docker environment.

**Objective:**


## Step 1: Set up the AI classroom
As a first step, you must set up your AI classroom for a better learning experience.

Before beginning the exercise, you must:

### 1. Name the chat: 
Use the pencil icon available on the top-left corner of the right pane to name the chat.

<img src="#" alt="name of chat">

### 2. Choose the model: 
Use the dropdown option from the top-right corner of the right pane for the text generation exercise.

## Step 2: Start Generating Dokerfile

### 1. Give prompt instructions: 
Use the Prompt Instructions field on the upper right pane of the chat system to provide instructions or any specific details about the context of the required output. These instructions will be locked when you start the chat and cannot be modified later.

Set prompt instructions given below: 
```
1. Start with the official Node.js runtime as the base image.
2. Set the working directory inside the container to /app.
3. Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files to the working directory.
4. Install application dependencies using npm install --production.
5. Copy the remaining application code to the working directory.
6. Expose port 3000.
7. Specify the command to start the Node.js application using CMD.
8. Assume the main file is named app.js; adjust accordingly based on your application's entry point file.
```

### 2. Type your message: 
Use the text box available at the bottom of the page to write the prompts and converse with the chat system.

Enter your prompt for generate a dokerfile `Generate a Dockerfile for a Node.js application` and  click on `Start Chat`

Sure! Here's a Dockerfile that you can use for a Node.js application:

```
# Step 1: Use the official Node.js runtime as the base image
FROM node:latest

# Step 2: Set the working directory inside the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Step 4: Install application dependencies using npm install --production
RUN npm install --production

# Step 5: Copy the remaining application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Step 6: Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Step 7: Specify the command to start the Node.js application using CMD
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

Please note that in Step 8, the command assumes that your main file is named app.js. You may need to adjust it based on your application's entry point file.

Finally you will get a complete `Dockerfile`
