*Note: Please note Generative AI is an evolving field. As you attempt the labs, your experience and output might be different than what is seen here.*

In this lab, we'll explore how generative AI can assist in creating a Dockerfile for a Node.js application. We'll be utilizing IBM's generative AI lab, powered by advanced language models. The goal is to generate the necessary code for our Dockerfile, simplifying the development of our Node.js application in a Docker environment.

Prologue: 

#### What is a Dockerfile and why do we use the same?

A Dockerfile is like a recipe for your application's environment. It contains a set of instructions that Docker uses to build a Docker image. This image, in turn, is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. 

Dockerfiles are crucial in the world of containerization, offering a standardized and reproducible way to package and deploy applications. They allow developers to encapsulate their applications and dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments. This not only simplifies the development process but also facilitates seamless collaboration and deployment. 


### Now, let’s direct a few questions to Generative AI to craft a Dockerfile.

## Step 1: Set up the AI Classroom

The generative AI classroom is a tool where you can write and compare your prompts to generate desired text with real-time chat responses.  

You will have both the generative AI classroom environment and instructions on one page in a browser. The instructions will be on the left half of the screen, and the generative AI classroom will be on the right half of the screen. You can interact with the language model using the message and chat fields.  

Your AI Classroom will look similar to the screenshot shown below:

To begin, configure your AI classroom to optimize your learning experience, by following these steps:

#### 1. Name the Chat:
Click the pencil in the top-left corner to give your chat a name.

#### 2. Choose the Model:
Go to the top-right corner and choose gpt-3.5-turbo from the drop-down for the text generation exercise. (By default, it's set to gpt-3.5.)

#### 3. Provide Prompt Instructions:
Use the "Prompt Instructions" field in the upper right pane of the chat system to give instructions or specific details about the context of the required output. These instructions will be locked once the chat starts and cannot be modified later.

#### 4. Type Your Message:
Use the text box at the bottom of the page to enter queries and converse with the chat system. Enter your prompt to generate a Dockerfile, `Generate a Dockerfile for a Node.js application,` and click on `Start Chat.`

7. Enter your question in message box `Node.js app needs to be accessible on a specific port, what Dockerfile instruction do you include for this purpose?`

Learn the instruction to include for exposing a specific port.

<img src="./images/expose_ports.png" alt="Expose Port">


8. Enter your question in message box `how to specify the command to start the Node.js application using CMD ?`

Understand the final step in specifying the command to start the Node.js application.

<img src="./images/start_cmd.png" alt="Start Command">

9. Enter your question in message box `Combine all the steps to form a complete Dockerfile for a Node.js application`

View the generated Dockerfile as a result of combining all the steps.
